# bot_project
My first project in Java
I have learned how to use a simple bot to interact with user. I have also added a 
multiple-choice quiz about programming test and the bot will check the answers.
The bot will repeat the test until the answer is correct and congratulate the user
upon completion.
Below is an example of the final version of the bot

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter the remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22: that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 3
0!
1!
2!
3!
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.

Please, try again.

Congratulations, have a nice day!
